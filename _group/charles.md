Charles Reisner (F&M '24) completed an Honors Thesis based on code he wrote to infer the physical conditions (gas metallicity, stellar metallicity, ionization, and reddening) of nebular regions of galaxies based on their observed spectra. He created a MCMC code that matched observed emission-line measurements with the best-fitting photoionization model generated by Cloudy.
