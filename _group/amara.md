A. Nusbickel (F&M '23) worked on generating large samples of galaxy images with two-component spatial profiles to represent a stellar component and a Lya halo. After generating these models for range of stellar and Lya profile parameters, the images were convolved with the empirical PSF before extracting fluxes in various spatial apertures in order to understand how the halo and PSF properties affected the recovery of Lya emission in fiber-based spectroscopy.
