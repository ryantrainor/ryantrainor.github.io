Io Kovach (F&M '23) worked on several projects related to modeling different aspects of stars, galaxies, and AGN. They initially constructed spatial PSF models for ground-based and space-based imaging before eventually moving to generating Cloudy photoionization models for galaxies and AGN in the early Universe.
