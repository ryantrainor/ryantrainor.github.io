Hi! I'm an Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA.

My research is centered on the evolution of galaxies in the early Universe. In particular, I seek to understand
"feedback" in galaxy formation: how the lives and
deaths of stars shape the evolution of
galaxies. My work includes making measurements of
the production of elements in forming galaxies, the
explosions that accelerate gas and set the tempo of star-formation,
the escape of ionizing photons from galaxies, and the
effects of some of the brightest quasars (aka,
"active" black holes) on the gas and galaxies around
them. Exciting stuff!
      
How can a black hole be bright? What on Earth (or rather, *not* on
Earth) is a redshift? Find answers to these
questions (and more!) on my [Research](research) page!

I am also passionate about connections between physics & astronomy and our world--what we can learn about ourselves from studying the Universe, and how social forces and our humanity shape the process of science as well. You can read about one particularly meaningful connection between my research and former F&M student Vicente "Chente" Brambila at [this page](chente) celebrating his life.

Originally from California, and I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at [UC Irvine](https://www.physics.uci.edu/) (Zot Zot!), my PhD in Astrophysics at Caltech, and a Miller Postdoctoral Felowship at [UC Berkeley](http://astro.berkeley.edu/) before moving to F&M.  When I'm not teaching or doing research in galaxy formation, I like to spend time with my kids, watch [baseball](https://twitter.com/Dodgers) or [soccer/football](https://twitter.com/LiverpoolFC) games, [~~tweet~ skeet(?)](https://bsky.app/profile/crosstrainor.bsky.social), and [take photos](https://www.flickr.com/people/148328039@N08/).
